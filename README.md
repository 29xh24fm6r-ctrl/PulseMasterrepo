# Pulse System

**Pulse is not an app that does many things. Pulse is the environment in which everything else happens.**

Pulse is a comprehensive **Life Operating System** designed to act as the central nervous system for human agency. It integrates Finance, Health, Time, and Energy into a single, cohesive power surface.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Brain-First**: Pulse models the user's cognitive state, not just their tasks.
2.  **Autonomy-Safe**: AI agents operate under strict "Constrained Autonomy" protocols (`L0` to `L3`).
3.  **High-Density**: The interface assumes intelligence, prioritizing data density over simplicity.

## Current State (Phases 7–13)
*   **Phase 13**: Power Surface (Command Bridge & Life State Model) - *Active* - `/bridge` is the canonical entry point.
*   **Phase 12**: Feedback Loops
*   **Phase 11**: Autonomy (Constrained)
*   **Phase 10**: Trust Architecture

## Contributor Protocols (Hardened)
*   **The root directory is sacred.** No logs, scratch files, or unauthorized scripts.
*   **No debugging artifacts in git.** Use local `.env` or non-tracked files only.
*   **Specs > Code.** All major changes must be spec'd in `/docs` before implementation.
*   **Canon is Law.** Follow the architectural patterns defined in `/docs/architecture`.

## Documentation
See `/docs` for authoritative specifications:
*   `/docs/architecture`: System design and core engines.
*   `/docs/phases`: Historical and active phase contexts.
*   `/docs/decisions`: ADRs and philosophical constraints.
